To convert your Python code into an executable (.exe) file, you can use a Python package called PyInstaller. Here are the steps:

Install PyInstaller by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:


pip install pyinstaller

Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where your Python code is located.

Run the following command to create a standalone executable file:


pyinstaller --onefile --windowed your_script_name.py

Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of your Python script. The --onefile option creates a single executable file, while the --windowed option hides the console window during the execution of the program.

Wait for PyInstaller to finish building the executable. Once it's done, you should see a new dist directory in your project folder containing the executable file.

That's it! You can now distribute the executable file to others without requiring them to install Python or any other dependencies.
